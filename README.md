# *About This Project*

I'm a second-year student at *UADE University* in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a strong passion for *microarchitecture* and everything related to digital system design.

In this repository, I’m collecting *basic elements* that I've studied and continue to explore — inspired and guided by *open-source materials*, *free online courses*, *technical articles*, *books*, and of course, the *official documentation from Xilinx* (Product Guides and User Guides).

Many of the examples here are *adapted from public sources* and used as learning material. In some cases, I’ve tried to *simplify, clean up, or slightly improve* the original code to make it more understandable and practical.

For example, I’ve used parts of the course "Digital Logic Synthesis School" , the GitHub repository by Yury Panchul, and examples from the book *"FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples"* by Pong P. Chu.

This is a work in progress, and I'm continuously learning and updating the content as I grow in my understanding of FPGA design.
